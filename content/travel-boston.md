Before start this post, I want to thank the OpenStack Foundation to help me attend
the OpenStack Summit BOSTON! ‚ù§


# Outreachy


Second, but no less important I had the opportunity to meet the great 
[@marinaz](https://twitter.com/marinaz): Outreachy founder üòâ She had
the great idea to meet all the interns attending to the summit!

I didn‚Äôt expect that happens ever, It was an unique moment when Marina,
[@vkmc](https://twitter.com/vkmc) (also an important Outreachy organizer)
and us had dinner, talk about the future of Outreachy and ways to
improved it.

One of the ideas I really like, is to implement a registration dashboard
to help interns know which projects are more solicited and made choose
easier. Some times you don‚Äôt know about all the companies listed and I
could be a easy way to get a look. What do you think? So, Let‚Äôs go!

# Edward Snowden interview üòÆ
When a saw on Twitter that Mark Collier was asking for suggested questions
for his interview with Edward Snowden, I shocked. This keynote interview was
amazing, an experience that I wont forget easily. From a remote location,
Snowden fielded questions that OpenStack community submitted via Twitter,
including why open source infrastructure matters in regards to data privacy
and the ethical implications of working in open source:

# WOO

I have the chance to be part of the Women of Openstack lunch and enjoy the
enterview to powerfull women inside the industry.

# It‚Äôs time for Latin America 

On Thursday morning, more than 30 technical leaders from the Latin America
Movil and Claro teams met here in Boston with members of the OpenStack
Foundation to discuss plans. The result?  They now have plans to drive
community building in Latin America and bring like-minded community members
and users together through meetups and OpenStack Days events. As an Latin
member of the community I‚Äôm really waiting for this to happens!!! There‚Äôs
not OpenStack Days events near to me and I want to be part!
