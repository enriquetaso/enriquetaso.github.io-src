# Internship

OPNFV is an open source project within The Linux Foundation that facilitates development
and evolution of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) components across various open
source ecosystems through integration, deployment, and testing. 

My primary goal while interning at [OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org/) was to containerize
VNFs running in Kubernetes and provide the applications to the community. It was a
very different experience for me interning for OPNFV because my team was based in
China. I’ve never had to work with a team in a different time zone. I learned a lot,
and it has taught me a great deal about effective communication. I can say hands down,
working as an OPNFV intern was one of the coolest things that have happened to me. 

My favorite task was to containerize the [Clearwater Project](http://www.projectclearwater.org/)
with the help of [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/).
For those who don't want to search: Clearwater is an open source implementation of IMS
(the IP Multimedia Subsystem) designed from the ground up for massively scalable
deployment in the Cloud to provide voice, video and messaging services to millions of
users and Kubeadm for creating a single master cluster.

Since my internship, I have worked on a paper about the *benefits of VNFs and cloud
computing* (in Spanish) that was selected for CoNallsi 2018 (Argentine Congress of
Engineering).

# Plugfest

ETSI hosted OPNFV at their facilities in Sophia Antipolis for a co-located
hackfest/plugfest June 4-8, 2018. The Event focused on interoperability of the OPNFV
platform in deployment, network integration, VNF applications, etc. on the **Fraser release**.

Over thirty people attended the event, most OPNFV members and contributors. I had a great
time hearing the sessions about OPNFV Verified Program (OVP), Barometer, installers, XCI,
and the new Lab-as-a-Service (LaaS) offering as well as hosting a hackfest where community
members collaborated on their respective projects, with sessions spanning edge computing,
MANO integration, individual project planning, and community-focused discussions.

I met incredible people there, and I'm appreciative to the Linux Foundation to help me
attend with the travel support program.
