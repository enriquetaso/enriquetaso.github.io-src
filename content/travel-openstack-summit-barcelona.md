*OpenStack is much more than just a specific set of software with discrete features.
OpenStack is also the community that comes together to collaboratively creates
technology, innovate and puh the state of computing forward. OpenStack software
powers digital bussiness at some of the biggest companies and scientific efforts
in the world. Wal-Mart runs online retail on OpenStack. BBVA and Banco Santander
run customer-facing workloads on OpenStack . The European Organization for Nuclear
Reaseach (CERN) processes massive amounts of data from the Large Hadron Collider
to analyzer the fundamentals of physics using OpenStack. And the OpenStack community
shares lessons learned about cloud usage and the cultural shifts we face with the
changing technology landscape of today.*

# THE WORLD RUNS ON OPENSTACK
*25 â€“ 28 October 2016*

My first summit just passed.

Four days of adventures. I have never participated in a event so massive: workshops,
talks, the Marketplace.

I felt comfortable speaking english, as Iâ€™m Spanish-speaker, language communication
represented  one of my fears. Attending  to a international summit for first time,
with  people from all over the worldâ€¦ I had to be able to share an interesting
conversation. Finally, this issue was not big deal. I tried my best and I think people
understand me  ðŸ˜›


I love being part of this summits.

# DESIGN SUMMIT
The four-days  summit is divided between the normal summit and the Design Summit, which
is set on the last days. At Design Summits the developers community gathers to
brainstorm the requirements for the next release, discuss the implementation details
and connect with other community members.

I joined the Cinder room to be part of the discussion, and finally met the people
behind the IRC. It was really intense and people discussed about the future of
cinder and next releases.

# OUTREACHY INTERNS

I met  OpenStack interns for round 12 and some of the old rounds too. It was excited
to share the activity and energy around OpenStack with them.

It was great to see such a diverse, global group of users, developers and business
leaders at this Summits. Iâ€™m honored to be part of this community.


# Talks
*How to become a significant contributor to OpenStack if you live outside the US*.
Since Iâ€™m from Argentina: one of my main challenge are locale requirement. I really
feel represented with this talk.
